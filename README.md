## Back-End Project: Bookshelf API
### A RESTful API that mimicks the functionality of a bookshelf with CRUD methods

<br>

This API is developed using Node.js with Hapi framework to assist in building a web server. 

To evaluate the API's capabilities, the Postman collection and environment is included in this repository on the *postman-testing* folder.

Note: this project is originally made in order to complete the "Creating a Back-End App Class" offered by Dicoding and receive a [certification](https://www.dicoding.com/certificates/MEPJKQ8YQX3V).
